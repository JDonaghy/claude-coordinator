"""#2170 -- the ambient-``$HOME`` regression pin, in the CI-invisible direction.

Six tests passed on ``ubuntu-latest`` (3.12 and 3.13) and failed on *every*
fleet machine, on ``origin/main``, for months. The consequence was not six red
tests: it was that the **Test stage on `precision` could not produce a green
verdict for this repo on any branch**. Every dispatch there returned
``SMOKE: fail``, blamed the branch, and cost a human verdict to adjudicate
(claude-coordinator#2158's Test leg: $0.61, 11m36s, zero signal about the
branch).

WHY CI COULD NOT SEE IT. The familiar version of this bug is "passes on my
machine, fails in CI ⇒ something ambient in ``$HOME``". These three are the
**inverse**: they pass in CI *precisely because* CI's ``$HOME`` is empty, and
fail wherever it isn't. Same class, flipped direction -- and a green
``ubuntu-latest`` matrix is structurally incapable of catching that direction,
because the only environment it ever tests is the empty one.

So the fix cannot be only "fix the three tests" (that clears today's six and
nothing more). It has to include a job that runs them in the environment that
breaks them. That is this file: it drives the three ambient-sensitive targets
in a subprocess whose environment is a *hostile* reproduction of a real fleet
machine --

1. a populated ``~/.coord/`` holding ``client.toml`` (so `coord` is a thin
   client) and a ``coordinator.remote.yml`` cache, and **no**
   ``coordinator.yml`` -- exactly `precision`'s shape;
2. ``sqlite3`` masked off ``$PATH`` -- it is not a provisioned fleet
   dependency and ``[dev]`` extras cannot install a system binary;
3. a ``$TMPDIR`` whose *ancestor* holds a ``pyproject.toml`` with
   ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]``, which is what shifts a nested pytest's
   inferred rootdir and mangles the JUnit ``classname`` the ids are derived
   from.

Each of the three knobs reproduces exactly one of the three original failures,
and each is asserted to be genuinely hostile by
:func:`test_the_hostile_environment_is_actually_hostile` -- without that
second test, a masking helper that quietly stopped masking would leave this
file green for the wrong reason, which is the same silent-green failure mode
the issue is about.

Deliberately NOT a re-run of the whole suite: recursion aside, the value is in
pinning the three known-sensitive targets permanently and cheaply (~10s), not
in doubling every CI run.
