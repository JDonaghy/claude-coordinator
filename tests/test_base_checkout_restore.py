"""#1694 — a base checkout parked on a work branch must be cleared, not just
refused.

#1693 stopped ``_git_worktree_add`` from *deleting* the base checkout when the
collision path named it.  That is correct and had to ship first, but a refusal
is not a resolution: the base is still parked on the branch, so every later
dispatch against that branch on that machine fails identically until a human
runs ``git checkout``.  #1659's own docstring calls the parked state "routine",
and ``coord fix``'s same-branch re-dispatch makes it "near-certain on a retry".

Two halves are tested here:

* **Part A** — nothing should leave the base parked in the first place.  The
  deterministic offender was ``coord.conflict_fix``'s briefing, which told the
  worker to ``cd <base checkout>`` and ``git checkout <work branch>`` there
  even though the agent had already handed it a worktree on exactly that
  branch.  Belt and braces, the agent now puts the base back at teardown when
  it is parked on the finished assignment's own branch.
* **Part B** — when the collision happens anyway, ``_git_worktree_add`` clears
  it non-destructively and retries once.

Every "refuses" test asserts the base is left **byte-identical**: same branch,
same working tree, same commits.  Nothing here may ever delete or discard.
