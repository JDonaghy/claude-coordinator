"""#1630 (H-3, agent side): /health carries the H-1 check registry's results.

Extends the existing `/health` payload (coord.agent.AgentServer.health) with
a `"health"` block — this machine's own check-registry run, cache-refreshed
on a timer rather than computed inline on every poll (mirrors the existing
`tool_versions`/`worktree_bytes` caches in the same class). Never touches
`coord/serve_app.py`'s aggregation — that's covered by
`tests/test_fleet_health_snapshot.py`.
