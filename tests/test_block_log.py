"""Unit tests for coord/block_log.py — #2235's Phase-0 stall log.

The load-bearing claim of #2235 is that the queue's *stated* block reason and
the *actual* cause disagree most of the time (five of seven, on the morning
that motivated the plan), and that Phase 1's scope must be decided from two
weeks of measured evidence rather than from that one sample. This file pins
the recorder that produces the evidence:

* it records a transition INTO and OUT OF ``blocked``/``parked``, and nothing
  else — a blocked entry that stays blocked is not an event;
* the stated reason is stored VERBATIM, and ``true_cause`` is empty on the way
  in, because at that instant nobody knows it;
* the release itself supplies the cause, classified from the marker the queue's
  own reconcile branch wrote (#2230 / #1891 / #2158 / #2063 / #2055);
* ``human_acted`` is true for exactly the releases a person caused — an
  operator ``remove``, and the Gate-A sign-off that #2063 polls for;
* the writer never raises, because it runs inside a tick that is mid-way
  through applying real merge/attempt state.

The CLI-level suite (tests/test_cli_drive_queue.py) drives the same machinery
end to end through ``coord drive-queue tick`` / ``block-log``.
