"""#2275: reconcile a running board row the agent has no record of.

The passive reconcile (#625, on #1616's 30s daemon clock) used to conflate two
cases with opposite correct handling — "still running on the agent" and "the
agent has no record of this at all" — behind one `continue`, and so left both.
Because `_COMPLETED_HISTORY_CAP` is 25, the second case is a *certainty* rather
than a race: a leg that dies needs only 25 further completions on its machine
before its id is gone from `/status` forever.

claude-coordinator#2208 is the worked example: a `[smoke]` Test leg died, its
board row stayed `status=running` for 11 hours, the drive burned both attempts
against a 240m deadline on a branch that was already green, and a human running
`coord status` cleared it — merge-READY 14 minutes later.

**This arm reaps**, so the exclusion tests below matter more than the happy
path.  #1658 (reaping live headless workers) is what getting it wrong costs.
