"""Tests for coord/dead_end.py — the driver's dead-end predicate (#2019).

The bug this closes is not "the driver was slow". It is that ``coord drive``
had no way to say **"finished in a state I cannot act on"**, so it said
``no state change in 140.558m`` instead, forever, while holding a tmux
session, a drive-queue slot and a per-repo capacity lane (#1972).

The two properties under test, in priority order:

1. **It never fires on a healthy row.** A false positive escalates a
   legitimately quiet long-running stage, which is strictly worse than the
   bug. Hence the first block below, and hence `active_count > 0` being a
   hard precondition rather than one signal among several.
2. **It fires on the shapes the board makes PROVABLE**, with a reason naming
   the specific dead end and a recovery command — not on "looks quiet".
