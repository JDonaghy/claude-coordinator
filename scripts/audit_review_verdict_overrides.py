"""Audit historical reviews for a silently-rewritten verdict (#1456).

Before #1456, the #476 approve-with-nits gate in `coord/auto_loop.py` treated
an *unparseable* blocking count (`None`) as "zero blocking findings", so a
reviewer's well-formed `request-changes` could be rewritten in place to
`approve` and the work marked merge-ready — the only fail-OPEN defect in the
2026-07-26 sweep (observed on #1445).  Nothing recorded that the override
happened: only the final value was stored.

This script recovers those cases from the one place the reviewer's own verdict
survived — the `review_findings` JSON blob, which carries the verdict as
parsed straight out of the reviewer's log (`{"verdict": ..., "body": ...}`)
alongside the assignments row's effective `review_verdict`.  A row where the
blob says `request-changes` but the column says `approve`, with no
`review_verdict_original` recorded, is a pre-#1456 silent override.

Read-only: runs SELECTs against `~/.coord/coord.db` and prints a report.  It
writes nothing and dispatches nothing.
