"""Phase 1 of #2235's queue-rescue plan (#2276) — the read-only diagnostician.

**What this is.**  Phase 0 (:mod:`coord.block_log`) records what the queue
*said* when it stopped.  #2235's load-bearing finding is that the queue was
wrong five times out of seven: *"stale test verdict"* where the truth was a
four-branch conflict, *"CI red, 2/2 attempts"* for a build that went green 23
minutes later.  Phase 0 cannot fix that on its own — it writes
``true_cause: ""`` on entry (nobody knows it yet) and, on exit, derives a
cause from *the release the queue itself performed*, which is still the queue
talking about itself.

So this module re-derives the blocker from **live state** — the PR's
lifecycle, ``gh pr view --json mergeable``, ``gh pr checks``, the live gate
decision ``coord gates`` renders, and the agent's ``/health`` — and writes the
answer back as the episode's ``true_cause``.  That column is what #2270's
report reads and what Phase 2 (#2268, still gated) would be scoped from.

**It mutates nothing.**  No board write, no queue write, no ``gh`` verb that
is not a read, no dispatch, no merge.  Its only output is a ``diagnosis``
record appended to the Phase-0 log — its own file, which no decision path
reads.  ``tests/test_block_log.py`` proves that byte-for-byte rather than
asserting it.

**Four rules it is built around.**

1. *The stated reason is an input to be contradicted, never a starting
   hypothesis.*  :func:`diagnose` derives a cause from the live readings
   alone; the stated reason is consulted only at the end, to ask whether the
   evidence still SUPPORTS it (:func:`_stated_still_supported`).  A
   diagnostician that anchors on the stated reason reproduces the
   five-of-seven failure it exists to correct.
2. *It does not own a clock.*  The trigger is #1632's stall detector, whose
   events :func:`stalled_keys` reads.  Two competing definitions of "stalled"
   is the defect class #1440 names, so there is deliberately no threshold, no
   age comparison and no ``now - x >`` anywhere in this module.
3. *``unknown`` is a first-class verdict.*  Thin evidence emits
   :data:`CAUSE_UNKNOWN` with :data:`CONFIDENCE_NONE`, and nothing penalises
   it.  A diagnostician that is confidently wrong is strictly worse than one
   that abstains, because Phase 2 would inherit the confidence.
4. *It has its own budget.*  :data:`MAX_DIAGNOSES_PER_EPISODE` bounds how
   often one stall may be re-diagnosed, so a diagnosis that cannot conclude
   cannot loop — the shape #2272 is about.

**Where it runs, and why not as a worker.**  It needs ``gh``, and ``gh`` is
denied to workers (#1483) — so it is emphatically *not* a ``coord assign``
worker.  It runs in-process on the coordinator host: hung off the notifier
tick inside ``coord serve`` (see :func:`coord.notifier.service.diagnose_pass`),
and on demand from ``coord drive-queue diagnose``.  Both are places that
already hold the operator's ``gh`` credentials and already read the board, so
Phase 1 adds no new trust boundary and no new credential.  A worker leg would
have needed one, for a task whose entire output is a log line.

    (the CLI path) and ``FleetHealthRefresher.snapshot().to_dict()`` (the
    notifier tick) — build rows via

    every configured machine read "reachable", which is worse than useless
    here: it left ``agent-unreachable`` structurally unreachable AND let
    ``_rule_dead_leg`` fire at high confidence on a machine that is merely
    down, which is the "confidently wrong" failure mode Phase 1 exists to
    avoid.

    Three answers, and the abstention is load-bearing:

    * ``None`` — no usable reading.  ``unknown`` (never polled, or an
      unclassifiable error), a missing/blank ``state``, or a ``stale`` row
      (nothing has polled inside ``STALE_AFTER_SECONDS``, i.e. no tick loop
      is running on this host).  Stale is deliberately ``None`` for a
      *non-online* state too: an "offline" reading from an hour ago is not
      evidence about now, in either direction.
    * ``True`` — a fresh ``online``.
    * ``False`` — a fresh, recognised, non-online state.
