"""Core ``coord acceptance`` orchestration (#944, docs/ORACLE_LOOP.md).

Pure/testable logic shared by the ``coord acceptance run`` / ``record`` CLI
commands in ``coord/commands/acceptance.py``: manifest loading (test-id ->
issue slice mapping) and building the structured verdict payload from a
driver's parsed test results.  Kept separate from the CLI so it can be unit
tested without Click's invocation machinery, mirroring the
``test_orchestrator.py`` / ``commands/test_gate.py`` split.

Layout this module expects (docs/ORACLE_LOOP.md "Layout"):

    tests/acceptance/ms-NN/
        contract.md          # black-box surface (not read by this module)
        mocks/                # viewable mocks == assertion fixtures
        <suite files>         # SEALED to the worker
        manifest.(yml|json)   # test-id -> issue-slice mapping
