"""Parentage seam (#1195) — backend-agnostic parent/child API over the
issue-store seam.

Every gap in the "Epic as a first-class parent" milestone is downstream of
parentage being **plain text** today: the epic->child relation is the ``##
Work order`` / ``## Sub-issues`` markdown checklist
:mod:`coord.milestone_order` parses (:func:`coord.milestone_order.
parse_sub_issues`). GitHub's REST sub-issues API is live on this repo but
used nowhere — there is no structural parent link for anything to reconcile
against.

This module is the narrow contract the future :issue:`183` pluggable
``IssueStore`` refactor will slot a real backend-selection policy into. Until
then it ships two concrete adapters behind the identical
:class:`ParentageStore` shape:

* :class:`coord.parentage_github.GitHubParentage` — the live GitHub
  sub-issues REST API (``GET``/``POST``/``DELETE .../sub_issues``).
* :class:`MarkdownParentage` — the ``## Sub-issues`` checklist fallback for
  GitLab / SQLite / no-API backends (and, today, the cheap path the
  board-payload publish step uses — see ``coord/serve_app.py``'s ``board()``
  handler — since a live API call per pipeline row per poll isn't
  affordable).

Callers reach either backend through the same method names/signatures so
neither the board-payload builder nor a future ``coord`` command has to
branch on which one is live — that's precisely what keeps #183 (pluggable
issue store) viable.

    """Fallback adapter (#1195): the ``## Sub-issues`` checklist convention
    #1008 already established for backends with no native sub-issues API
    (GitLab / SQLite / no-API).

    ``children()`` parses *body* — the tracking issue's OWN body — with
    :func:`coord.milestone_order.parse_sub_issues`. No network call, so this
    is also what the board-payload publish step uses even on a GitHub-backed
    repo: a live sub-issues API call per epic per poll isn't affordable, and
    (until EP-2 backfills existing epics) the markdown checklist is the only
    populated source of truth anyway.

    #1197 fix-iteration finding: an "epic" tracking issue's ``## Work
    order`` block (#767/#645 — the milestone's DAG of work items, written by
    ``coord milestone write-order``) already names the exact same
    parent->children relationship the newer ``## Sub-issues`` checklist
    (#1008, written only by the separate, opt-in ``coord milestone
    add-child``) is meant to encode — but plenty of existing epics (this
    milestone's own #1200 tracking issue included) predate #1008 and were
    never additionally seeded with a ``## Sub-issues`` block, so
    ``parse_sub_issues`` legitimately finds nothing even though the epic
    unambiguously has children. Pass ``fallback_to_work_order=True`` to
    treat an empty/absent ``## Sub-issues`` block as "fall back to ``##
    Work order``" instead of "no children" — this is what the board-payload
    children projection (the Pipeline nesting feature) opts into; it
    defaults to ``False`` so the #1196 close-guard (:func:`coord.
    github_ops.get_open_children`) keeps its narrower, deliberately
    conservative behavior unchanged.

    ``parent()`` has no reverse pointer to walk — the checklist lives on the
    PARENT's body, not the child's — so callers must supply *epics*: every
    candidate tracking issue as ``{"number": int, "state": str, "body":
    str}``. The first whose ``## Sub-issues`` checklist names *issue_number*
    is the parent; ``None`` when no candidate does (or none were supplied).

    The checklist's ``- [x]`` / ``- [ ]`` box is the only completion signal
    this convention carries, so it doubles as the child's reported ``state``
    here (``"closed"`` for checked, ``"open"`` otherwise) — an approximation
    of the real GitHub issue state, good enough for nesting/display, not a
    live lookup.
