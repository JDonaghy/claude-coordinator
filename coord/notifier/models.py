"""Event vocabulary for the fleet notifier (#1632).

The notifier answers exactly one question — *"has the pipeline stopped, or
stalled, in a way that will not advance without a human?"* — and pushes the
answer to a phone.  It is deliberately **not** an error channel: a failed
test, a request-changes review and a mechanical merge conflict are all
handled by the auto-loop, and pushing them is precisely the noise that
trains an operator to mute the channel.  In normal operation this fires
approximately never.

Everything in this module is a plain value type with no I/O, so the
predicate that produces these events stays unit-testable without a network
(#1632 acceptance).

# available probe for a subject rather than averaging several weak ones
