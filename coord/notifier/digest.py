"""Quiet hours as a **deferral window**, not a filter (#1632).

Events raised between ``start`` and ``end`` are held, coalesced, and
delivered as a *single digest* the moment the window closes.  Nothing is
discarded: you are not disturbed, you are still told.

Two rules this module exists to make structural rather than aspirational:

* **No severity level pierces quiet hours.**  There is no `priority` input
  anywhere in this file.  Severity is assigned by the sender, and a
  receiver who gets woken by things that did not warrant it mutes the
  channel within a month — at which point the whole feature is dead.
* **The exception is a deadline, not a severity.**  A drive the operator
  explicitly marked urgent opts *itself* out, for its duration.  That is
  :attr:`~coord.notifier.models.NotifyEvent.urgent`, it is opt-in, it is
  scoped to one drive, and it expires with that drive.

The window itself is :class:`coord.models.QuietHours` — the same value type
`coord pause` already uses for per-machine dispatch windows (#1862),
reused rather than reinvented so the fleet does not end up with two
independently-drifting definitions of "night".
