"""Phase 0 stall log (#2235) — every ``blocked``/``parked`` entry, recorded.

**What this is.** #2235's evidence table showed that *five of seven* overnight
stalls named a symptom rather than a cause: the queue said "stale test
verdict" where the truth was a four-branch conflict, said "CI red, 2/2
attempts" for a build that went green 23 minutes later.  That finding is the
load-bearing constraint on everything Phase 1+ might do, and it was
reconstructed by hand, once, from a single morning's triage.  Phase 1's scope
is explicitly gated on **two weeks of this log**.

So this module records, for every entry that reaches ``blocked`` or
``parked``:

* the reason the queue **stated** at the moment it stopped (verbatim), and
* how the entry eventually **left** that state — which is the only honest
  Phase-0 read on its *true* cause — and
* whether a **human had to act** to get it out.

**What the RECORDER is emphatically NOT.**  The writer above does not
diagnose.  It runs no ``gh`` call, re-derives no gate, and consults no live
state that the tick has not already fetched for its own purposes.

**Phase 1 (#2276) fills the column Phase 0 cannot.**  ``true_cause`` is empty
on every ``enter`` record — at that instant nobody knows it — and on ``exit``
it is derived from *the release the queue itself performed*, which is still
the queue talking about itself.  #2235's finding is that the queue is wrong
about this five times out of seven.  So :mod:`coord.queue_diagnose` re-derives
the cause from live state and appends a third record shape here,
:data:`EVENT_DIAGNOSIS`, which :func:`episodes` folds onto the open episode as
its ``true_cause``.  That module owns the *deriving*; this one owns the
*record*, the pairing, and the honesty accounting — how often the derived
cause later agreed with how the episode actually resolved
(:func:`agreement_for`), reported as a rate rather than assumed
(:func:`summarize`).  A diagnostician that is confidently wrong is worse than
one that abstains, which is why ``unknown`` is counted separately from
``disagreed`` and never folded into it.

**#2540 fills the column that neither Phase counts: operator effort that never
touched the queue's own command surface.**  ``human_acted`` was, until #2540,
true only for the narrow set of releases the queue itself can attribute to a
person — an operator's ``remove``, a Gate-A sign-off.  Real recovery routinely
happens elsewhere entirely: a manual git rebase and force-with-lease push, a
direct ``coord test``/``coord merge --only``/``coord pr``/``coord fix``
against the assignment underneath an entry, a ``systemctl``/``coord agent
update``/``coord diagnose --reset`` on the machine running it.  None of that
is visible to a tick, so none of it was ever counted — a night of real manual
recovery could read as ``0 needed a human``, which is the exact failure this
module exists to prevent, just relocated one layer down.  This module cannot
detect that kind of intervention after the fact (recording must not probe live
state — see above), so :func:`intervention_event` gives an operator a place to
say so, in real time or shortly after: ``coord drive-queue log-intervention``
appends a record that :func:`episodes` folds onto whichever episode was open
for that key, or — if it had already resolved by the time the operator got to
logging it — the most recently closed one.  It flips ``human_acted`` to
``True`` the same as an ``operator_resolution_event`` does, and is kept
separately visible (``intervention_categories``) so the report can still say
*how* it knows, rather than asserting a single flat "a human acted" with no
paper trail behind it.

**Recording must never change a decision.**  Every public entry point here is
best-effort and swallows its own exceptions (:func:`record`), for the same
reason :mod:`coord.audit` does: the tick's merge/dispatch/attempt accounting
is the write that matters, and an observability append that can fail a tick is
strictly worse than no observability.  Nothing in this module is ever consulted
by :func:`coord.drive_queue.plan_tick` — it reads a plan that has already been
decided, and writes to a file no decision path reads.

**Storage.** One JSON object per line, appended, at
:func:`block_log_path`.  Append-only on purpose: an *episode* (entry blocked →
entry released) is two records that the reader pairs up (:func:`episodes`),
never one record mutated in place.  That keeps the writer a single ``O(1)``
append with no read-modify-write race between a tick and an operator command
running concurrently on the same host, and it keeps the raw file honest — a
resolution that contradicts an earlier one is visible rather than overwritten.

The file is per-host, because ticks are per-host and this is instrumentation,
not board state.  Reading two weeks of it off two machines is a ``cat``; a new
board table plus a daemon route is a schema migration and a network dependency
in the tick's write path, which is a poor trade for a temporary measurement.

    the plan cares most about, and dropping it would flatter the numbers.

    A ``resolve`` with no preceding ``enter`` (the log started mid-stall) is

    unknown cannot answer the one question this log exists to answer.

    """The counts #2235's success metric is defined in terms of.

    ``human_acted`` is the numerator that must trend DOWN.  It is reported
    alongside ``open`` (still stalled) rather than in isolation, because a
    queue that stops needing interventions by leaving everything blocked
    forever is the failure mode, not the goal — the two numbers are only
    meaningful together.

    ``repeat_causes`` is #2235's tripwire, in the weakest form Phase 0 can
    honestly support: the same ``(repo, stated_reason-prefix)`` stalling more
    than once.  The issue's framing — *a repeat is a bug report, not a
    success* — needs that count visible from day one, or the trend line has
    nothing to be checked against.

    ``diagnosis`` is #2276's own success criterion, and it is reported as a
    measurement rather than an assertion.  ``disagreement_rate`` is
    ``disagreed / (agreed + disagreed)`` and is ``None`` — not ``0.0`` — when
    nothing scorable has resolved yet, because a rate of zero out of zero
    reads as a perfect record.  ``abstained`` sits outside that fraction
    entirely: #2276 makes ``unknown`` a first-class verdict with no penalty,
    and putting it in the denominator would penalise it.  ``contradicted``
    counts the episodes where the live evidence positively ruled the queue's
    stated reason out — the five-of-seven number, finally measured instead of
    reconstructed by hand.

    ``human_acted_logged`` (#2540) is the subset of ``human_acted`` this build
    can actually SHOW ITS WORK for: episodes carrying at least one
    ``coord drive-queue log-intervention`` record.  The rest of ``human_acted``
    still comes from the pre-#2540 queue-command surface (an operator's
    ``remove``, a Gate-A sign-off) — real, but with no evidence trail beyond
    "the resolve record said so".  Neither of those two is a claim that
    *nothing else* happened: a night with ``human_acted_logged == 0`` means
    no intervention was LOGGED, not that none occurred — this module still
    cannot see a git rebase or a direct ``coord test`` call that nobody typed
    the one extra command for.  That is the honest limit of what an
    append-only log fed only by this process's own choke points can claim,
    and it is why the CLI help for ``log-intervention`` asks operators to run
    it as a matter of habit rather than treating the count as automatically
    complete.

# ── #2270: the outcome vocabulary the queue-outcomes report buckets on ───────
#
# One question — *what fraction of the queue got over the line without me?* —
# needs exactly two derivations over an episode, and both belong here rather
# than in `coord.reports`: this module owns what an episode MEANS, and a
# second opinion living next to the renderer is how `by_cause` and a report's
# categories drift apart.

#: Merged with no stall recorded at all.  Structurally **never** produced from
#: an episode — an episode IS a stall — so :func:`episode_bucket` cannot
#: return it.  The queue-outcomes report counts this bucket from the merge
#: events on the audit trail and says so in its notes; naming the constant
#: here keeps the five-bucket vocabulary in one place.
BUCKET_SUCCEEDED = "succeeded"
#: Stalled, then released by a deterministic arm that already exists (#1891
#: park auto-resume, #2230 blocked re-check, #2197 CI re-run, #2252 flaky
#: re-run) — i.e. a `resolve` whose ``human_acted`` is false.
BUCKET_AUTO_MECHANISM = "auto_resolved_mechanism"
#: Stalled, then released by the rescue AGENT (#2268).  **Structurally zero
#: today** — nothing writes a `resolve` with one of :data:`RESCUE_SOURCES` —
#: and modelled anyway, from day one, for two reasons #2270 is explicit
#: about: the report does not change shape when #2268 lands, and "a
#: deterministic arm fixed it" stays visibly distinct from "an agent judged
#: it" instead of being merged into one flattering number.
BUCKET_AUTO_RESCUE = "auto_resolved_rescue"
#: Stalled and a human acted.  Broken down by category, and split again by
#: :func:`is_by_design` — see that function for why the split is load-bearing.
BUCKET_HUMAN = "human"
#: Still stalled at the end of the window.  Reported beside the others rather
#: than dropped: a queue that stops needing interventions by leaving
#: everything blocked forever is the failure mode, not the goal.
