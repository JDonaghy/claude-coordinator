"""The driver's dead-end predicate (#2019).

``coord drive`` could not tell **"still working"** apart from **"finished in
a state I cannot act on."**  Both rendered as ``no state change in N m`` and
the second one looped forever — a counter incrementing against an event that
can never occur, holding a tmux session, a queue slot and (since #1972) an
entire repo's capacity lane.  The live case this module is named for burned
**140 minutes** on claude-coordinator#1956 with ``review=done/-`` on screen
the whole time.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS
-------------------
One pure function, :func:`detect_dead_end`, over the driver's already-computed
:class:`coord.drive_state.IssueState`.  It answers a single question:

    Is this row **terminal AND unactionable** — i.e. is there no board
    transition left that any amount of polling could produce?

It is **not** a stall detector.  Per #2019 ask 4, elapsed time is deliberately
NOT an input: a healthy long-running Work stage is legitimately quiet for
hours, and a dead end is knowable at minute zero.  The only clock-shaped
guard here is the hard precondition ``active_count == 0`` — if anything at all
is running on the fleet, this function returns ``None``, however long it has
been running.  That guard is what makes a false positive on a healthy stage
structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.

WHY THE 140 MINUTES HAPPENED (the field-mismatch bug)
-----------------------------------------------------
``coord.drive._decide_review`` has had a ``_die`` for "review finished with no
verdict" since the original bash port — but it keys on
``state.work_review_state``, the **work** row's projected ``review_state``.
The incident's board showed ``review=done/-``, which is
``state.review_status`` — the **review assignment's own** status.  On #1956
the review row reached ``status="done"`` while the work row's ``review_state``
was never advanced (advancing it is exactly what recording the verdict does),
so the die never fired and ``_decide_review`` fell through to a bare
``_wait()``.  Two readings of "the review is done", one checked, one not.
:data:`_TERMINAL_REVIEW_STATUSES` closes that by keying on the review row.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* COVERED
----------------------------------
* **A Test stage that was never dispatched, with no policy saying so**
  (``test_state=""``, no smoke row, no ``test-mode:*`` label) — from board
  state alone that is indistinguishable from "the daemon will dispatch it on
  the next tick", and the rest of the dispatcher's refusal set
  (``coord.smoke.dispatch_smoke`` returns ``None`` for a superseded row, a
  capability-rule miss on a non-``work`` type, a missing smoke command, …) is
  not re-derivable here without duplicating it.  Guessing would escalate
  healthy rows.  Two variants ARE covered, both because something on the board
  positively states that no dispatch is coming: ``test_state="blocked"``, the
  marker the dispatcher leaves when it gives up (#1672, shape 2), and
  ``test-mode:smoke``, the per-issue POLICY that switches the headless Test
  stage off entirely (#685/#2024, shape 3).
* **A ``done`` smoke row whose verdict has not landed yet** — #1605 already
  established that this has an expected, bounded propagation lag and is not a
  defect.  Only the contradictions #1605 itself detects are terminal.
* **A zero-commit advisory / a refused pre-dispatch guard** — already
  escalated correctly by ``coord.drive._decide_advisory``, the "finished with
  no branch" die, and #1844's ``EXIT_DISPATCH_REFUSED``.  vimcode#634 proved
  that path works; this module deliberately does not touch it.

The registry below is meant to grow one *proven* shape at a time.  A shape
belongs here only when the board state alone makes the row unactionable — not
when it merely looks quiet.
